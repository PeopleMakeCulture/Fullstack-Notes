## Ways to Vet Companies
	- hacky way to get a referral - just look for an engineer on LinkedIn, and put the name of an engineer who works there when they ask 'who refered you' 

	- maybe coding challenges are a bad idea? ask--how many software engineers are interviewing you? $300+?
	- ask about their on-call schedule
	- look at when they're committing code
	- do they care about security
	- do they have a well run interviewing process
	- are you alone during an interview? dead-time signals that they're dropping the ball --> ask why that happened (security risk)

	- ask before I come in, can I come in and walk around the office, talk to teammates, etc

## How to ask for help
	- Say "Here's my problem, I've  tried this and this, didn't work, what would you do?"

	- put "independent" on resume?
	- afterwards, put it in your documentation

## How do I show my value?
	- If you don't get mentorship can you still do something?
	- "I would love to have a mentor, b/c I'll imporve faster, but w/o it, I can still get the job done, and I've demonstrated that already w/ these projects"
	- Show that you can solve the problem
