# Intro C++

```
hello.cpp

include <>

int main(){
	std::cout << "Hello World\n"
}
```

Every C++ program must have a function called main()

The compiler (mostly) completely ignores the white space

## Compiling in the terminal
```
	g++ <myfilename> -o <outputfilename>
	./<executableoutputfilename>
