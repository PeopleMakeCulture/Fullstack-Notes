Review Qs:
1. Please go over Switch syntax (Source code: Monday's Bash workshop solution code)
2. Please go over example of subqueries (Source code: SQL workshop w/ IMDB, Kevin Bacon)

Misc:
	- GOL Board could be represented with an array of objects where each cell had a row key and a column key, instead of an array of arrayas

	- Firebase - check it out
	- Graph databases - check it out
